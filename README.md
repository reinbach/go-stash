# go-stash

go bindings for a minimal set of Stash REST APIs

Initially to provide Stash support to [drone.io](https://github.com/drone/drone) and heavily borrowed from [go-bitbucket](https://github.com/drone/go-bitbucket)


## Testing

### Setup Stash

One way to get that up and running is to make use of the atlassian/stash docker
(atlassian/stash)(https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/atlassian/stash/)

If you use the above Stash instance, then access the Stash instance at `http://localhost:7990/` and following the setup instructions.

#### Setup Test Project and Repo

#### Install Add On

In Administration Add-On section install the `HTTP Request Post-Receive Hook for Stash` add on.

#### Setup Application Link
